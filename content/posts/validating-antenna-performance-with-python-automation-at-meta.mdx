### **1. Prologue: A Mesh of Possibilities**

*As a Principal Engineer focused on Device Verification Testing (DVT), I helped translate signal performance into actionable results using Python, automation frameworks, and systems-level thinking.*

### **2. Context: What is Terragraph?**

 Meta’s open-source 60 GHz wireless technology designed to deliver high-speed, low-cost internet in urban settings.

Leveraging **phased-array antennas** and why testing them is non-trivial (millimeter-wave RF, beamforming, heat, signal integrity, etc.).

* [Facebook Connectivity Initiative](https://connectivity.fb.com)

### **3. Mission: Build Scalable, Repeatable Device Testing**

* Tasked with designing and automating end-to-end **Device Verification Testing (DVT)** for pre-production phased-array antennas.
* Wrote comprehensive Python automation suites for:

  * RF beam calibration and sweep tests.
  * Spectrum analyzer integration (via PyVISA, SCPI commands).
  * Cross-checks of antenna gain patterns and noise floor response.
* **Multi-device orchestration**, minimizing human intervention during tests

### **4. Documentation That Mattered**

* Authored internal design specs that **defined what "pass" meant**:

  * Antenna alignment tolerances.
  * Power output ranges and spectral purity.
  * Integration test protocols for mesh behavior and thermal tests.
* These documents became **reference standards** used by hardware teams across continents.

### **5. Data-Driven Debugging**

* Used Python to parse and visualize gigabytes of performance logs, identify drift and interference.
* Automated time-correlated plots comparing RF output vs. control signal logs for deeper root-cause detection.

### **6. Global Impact: Taiwan Training & Manufacturing QA**

* Flew to contract manufacturing facilities in Taiwan.
* Delivered hands-on training to QA and test engineers.
* Introduced Python-based test workflows to replace error-prone Excel macros.
* **Result**: reduced test failure rates by over 50% within 3 months.

### **7. Automation Wins**

* Unified test scripts across remote sites (US, APAC).
* Developed a Python harness with CLI-based test control and YAML-driven config.
* CI‑ready test packs allowed repeatable regression on each hardware revision.

### **8. Reflections**

* RF testing includes art + engineering, especially at 60 GHz, **which I love**
* Working on Terragraph prepared me for your later AR/VR roles (low-level measurement, large-scale automation, cross-team validation).

**Automation isn't just faster testing, it's repeatable knowledge transfer at scale.**
