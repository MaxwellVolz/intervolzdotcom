## Goal

Build PlayCatch.exe with minimal required: Scene Management, Character Movement, Object Creation, and Networking working via `SteamFriends`.


Following the [Mirror Quick Start Guide](https://mirror-networking.gitbook.io/docs/community-guides/quick-start-guide) to get a rock solid networking setup.

## Mirror Networking for local testing

Quick Start Notes:

* Step 8
  * Use: `GameObject - 3D Object - Legacy - TextMesh`
* Step 15
  * Fix them QUOTES `“SceneReference”` -> `"SceneReference"`
* Step 16
  * Add `using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;`
* Step 17
  * Had to relaunch editor to get function to show in the button dropdown

Everything Works!!

## Adding Steam.NET and FizzySteamworks to Unity

Unity → Edit → Project Settings → Player → **Other Settings**
* Api Compatibility Level → `.NET Framework 4.x`

### Install Steamworks.NET

Use Git URL:

```
https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET.git?path=/com.rlabrecque.steamworks.net#2024.8.0
```

Create `steam_appid.txt` at root of Unity project with contents `480`:

This allows your standalone builds to run SteamNetworking via AppID 480 ("Spacewar"—Steam’s test app).

### **Install FizzySteamworks via UPM**

Window ▶ Package Manager ▶ `+` ▶ Add from Git URL:

```
https://github.com/Chykary/FizzySteamworks.git?path=/com.mirror.steamworks.net
```

Once installed, check that:

* You see **FizzySteamworks** in your Packages list
* You can `Add Component ▶ FizzySteamworks` to your NetworkManager object

---

## Configure NetworkManager for FizzySteamworks

In **NetworkManager GameObject** (Prefab or Scene):

* **Add Component**: `FizzySteamworks`
* In `NetworkManager > Transport` → drag the FizzySteamworks component
* Delete `KCPTransport` if you’re not using fallback LAN play

---

## **Build**

Your final `.exe` or `.app` must live next to `steam_appid.txt` and be run via **Steam** client.

---

## Testing Steam Friends Multiplayer

> You **cannot** test P2P with yourself — Steam requires two separate accounts on different machines.

### Host

* Run the game build via Steam
* Click *Host*
* Press Shift+Tab → open Steam overlay → Invite Friend

### Client (Josh!)

* Run the game
* Accepts invite → joins automatically if `NetworkManager.StartClient()` is called

---

### Status: Failure!

| Step                      | Status           |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| .NET 4.x enabled          | ✅                |
| Steamworks.NET installed  | ✅                |
| steam\_appid.txt added    | ✅ (`480`)        |
| FizzySteamworks added     | ✅ (via UPM)      |
| Transport set to Fizzy    | ✅                |
| Built with correct scenes | ✅                |
| Steam running on both PCs | ✅                |
| Friends test via invite   | 🔜 Ready to test! |

Annnnnnnnd the test of friend-invite multiplayer with SteamNetworkingSockets **failed**!

## The "Steam AppID 480 (Spacewar) hijack" Problem

Steam’s AppID **480 (Spacewar)** is hardcoded to launch `spacewar.exe`.

If you invite a friend through Steam using AppID 480:
* Steam tries to launch **`spacewar.exe`** in their `steamapps/common/Spacewar/` directory.
* If your actual build is named `PlayCatch.exe` (or anything else), Steam ignores it.
* Result: Steam either launches the wrong thing, or nothing at all.

### Fix Option 1: Rename build to `spacewar.exe`

1. Build your game to a folder, e.g. `SteamTestBuild/`
2. Rename the output:
   * `PlayCatch.exe` → `spacewar.exe`
   * Leave `steam_appid.txt` as `480` in the same folder
3. Zip that folder and send it to your friend.
4. They must:
   * Extract it to a new folder (e.g. Desktop/SteamTest/)
   * Open `Steam`, let it run in the background
   * Launch `spacewar.exe` from that folder manually
   * You both do the same, from the same-named .exe

Now when `Josh` receives a Steam *Join Game* invite, Steam recognizes the AppID (`480`) and already sees that `spacewar.exe` is running—so it triggers the rich presence callback correctly without trying to launch something else.

> This works because Steam simply sees: “Oh, AppID 480 is running with `spacewar.exe`. Okay, send the join.”

---

### Fix Option 2: Install your build into `steamapps/common/Spacewar/`

Simulate a real “Steam install” by replacing the test app folder.

1. On both PCs remove contents of `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Spacewar\`
2. Copy built game into this folder
3. Launch SpaceWar **from Steam**
  * Library → Spacewar → *Play*
  * Steam launches `spacewar.exe`

Now Steam fully manages the AppID lifecycle, rich presence, and friend launching via the Join Game button.

> This is the most accurate test of how the game will behave on Steam once we have a real AppID.

## Summary Plan

| Task                                  | ✅ Fix                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Steam launches wrong thing or nothing | Rename your build to `spacewar.exe` OR install into `steamapps/common/Spacewar/`  |
| Steam launches wrong thing or nothing | Later: Install into `steamapps/common/Spacewar/`                                  |
| Join Game does nothing                | Use `GameRichPresenceJoinRequested_t` + `SetRichPresence("connect", steamID)`     |
| App doesn’t connect                   | Confirm SteamAPI is initialized and `StartClient()` uses correct `networkAddress` |

## Next To Add

- Rework Weapon.cs to be about holding a ball in hand
  - balls will be a list of prefabs
- ball networking
  - onCatch of a ball destroy the ball and put that ball from list in hand
  - if not holding a ball
    - network event to broadcast the player is now holding a ball
    - network event to broadcast to destroy the ball
