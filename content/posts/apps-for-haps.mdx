## Building TerraZed


### **1. Prologue: From Silicon to Screens**

I had just joined *Esencia Tech* to build something unusual. Putting a face on a primarily hardware project.

The system? A **High Altitude Psuedo Satellite**, a high-flying telecom tower delivering high-speed backhaul network connectivity across *26GHz* and *38GHz* mmWave bands.

### **2. The Challenge: From Hardware Logs to Strategic Insight**

* Problem: Data was raw, unstructured, and hardware-bound. Field engineers were relying on CLI tools and manual parsing of serial logs.
* Goal: Build a real-time monitoring and optimization web app to transform that telemetry into **actionable, visual insight**.
* Requirements:

  * Cross-phase consistency: research → development → testing → demos.
  * Reliable deployment from *benchmarking prototype boards in Menlo Park* to a **flight demo in the South African desert**.

### **3. The Stack: Full-Stack Engineering from Ground to Stratosphere**

* **Frontend**: React + Redux + WebSockets for live updates, custom visualization of RF metrics, link status, and signal power overlays.
* **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Python integration layer to interface with hardware systems (serial, RF analyzers).
* **Database**: InfluxDB time-series DB with custom data degradation.
* **DevOps**: Deployed applications for modular deployments across lab, field test, and demo environments.

### **4. React in the Field**

* Created responsive UIs with **live hardware and signal performance visualization** and configurable test scenario panels.
* Implemented time-synchronized overlays of system logs, antenna beam switching patterns, and signal quality trends.
* Focused on speed: WebSocket-backed charts with millisecond-level precision for system tuning.

### **5. Live in South Africa: The TerraZed Demo**

* Field-deployed the full system in **Oudtshoorn, South Africa** for a real-world HAPS network trial.
* My app provided **mission-critical live monitoring** for teams on the ground and remote HQ teams in California.
* The frontend visualizations played a central role in communicating performance metrics to stakeholders.

### **6. Impact: Productization and Acquisition**

* The system was demoed successfully to prospective partners.
* Ultimately acquired by **SoftBank**, who leveraged our app as part of the OEM handoff.

### **7. Reflection**

* In constrained RF environments:

  * **Frontend discipline** matters when your UI is the only surface to interpret high-frequency hardware behavior.
  * Hardware-software abstraction is the heart of successful fieldable technology.
  * Strong documentation, consistency in interface design, and modular APIs are non-negotiable.
* This project solidified my confidence in owning **full-stack delivery pipelines** from *kernel logs to the last pixel* on a stakeholder’s demo screen.
* It’s a highlight of my journey blending software engineering with frontier hardware.

## **Curious how much better modern full-stack tools can bring exotic RF platforms to life? I'm ready.**
