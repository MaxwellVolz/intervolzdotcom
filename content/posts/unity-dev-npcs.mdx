## Architecture

### 1. **Spawner GameObject**

Placed manually at doorsteps (or wherever). Each one controls a schedule for spawning NPCs.

**Spawner Script Responsibilities:**

* Timer to spawn NPCs at intervals (fixed or randomized)
* Keep track of active NPCs if you want to limit total (e.g. max # per spawner)
* Reference an NPC prefab to instantiate

### 2. **NPC Prefab**

* Includes `NavMeshAgent` for walking
* Has an `Animator` with a blend tree or simple state machine
* Uses root motion or syncs movement speed with `NavMeshAgent`
* References a "behavior" script for pathing and actions

\> Don't forget to install the tools!

### 3. **Movement Target System**

Use **Checkpoint GameObjects** in the scene (like path targets or nav anchors).

Options:

* Tag them (`"NPCTarget"`)
* Place them under a parent (`/NPCCheckpoints/`)
* Use a ScriptableObject list if you want dynamic ones per scene

Each NPC picks random ones to walk to and idles there, then picks another.

## ðŸ§  Best Practices Considered

* **Loose coupling**: Spawner doesn't know about how NPCs behave, only spawns them.
* **Scalability**: You can later assign specific behaviors per NPC type (e.g. loiter, buy coffee, sit on bench).
* **Multiplayer**: NPCs should be **server-authoritative**. Only server runs spawner and pathing logic, and syncs position and animations via network.

## ðŸ’¡ Optional Features (for later)

* **NPC pooling** instead of instantiate/destroy (for perf)
* **Scheduled spawn times** (e.g. 9amâ€“5pm active)
* **Behavior trees** or state machines for complex behavior

## ðŸ“Œ Implementation Breakdown

### `NPCSpawner.cs` (on the door)

* `spawnIntervalMin/Max`
* `npcPrefab`
* (optional, or just use its own transform)

### `NPCController.cs`

* Handles state (Idle, Walking, etc.)
* Picks a random destination from a list of walkable target transforms `Transform[] destinations`
* Uses `NavMeshAgent` to move there
* Triggers animator blend tree with speed

- - -

## ðŸ”— Network Considerations

* NPCs should only be spawned on the **server**
* NPC movement should be **synced with position + animation** (use Mirror `NetworkTransform` or custom sync if you want tight control)
* Avoid syncing pathfinding logic client-side

- - -

## **Tag-Based Target Discovery**

**Reasoning:** Just drop GameObjects in the scene and tag them `"NPCTarget"`.

## âœ… Proceeding to Implementation

Next, Iâ€™ll start with the `NPCSpawner.cs` script (server-side), then the `NPCController.cs` for basic wandering behavior.

Max concurrent NPCs per spawner

`NPCSpawner.cs`:

* **Mirror-based multiplayer**
* **Server-authoritative NPC spawning**
* **Randomized interval between `spawnIntervalMin` and `spawnIntervalMax`**
* **Max concurrent NPCs per spawner**
* **Spawns at its own transform** (can later be extended with offset array)
