## 
A Mesh of Possibilities


*As a Principal Engineer focused on Device Verification Testing (DVT), I helped translate signal performance into actionable results using Python, automation frameworks, and systems-level thinking.*

### Context: What is Terragraph?

Meta’s open-source 60 GHz wireless technology designed to deliver high-speed, low-cost internet in urban settings.

Testing this system is unique. The projects' backbone of leveraging **phased-array antennas** to establish an outdoor mesh network includes the addition of dealing with non-trivial interruptions from:

* beamforming
* signal integrity
* environment

### Mission: Build Scalable, Repeatable Device Testing

I was tasked with designing and automating end-to-end **Device Verification Testing (DVT)** for pre-production phased-array antennas.

This entailed developing comprehensive Python automation suites for:

* RF beam calibration and sweep tests.
* Spectrum analyzer integration (via PyVISA, SCPI commands).
* Cross-checks of antenna gain patterns and noise floor response.
* **Data visualizations** for heatmaps, antenna patterns, performance analyis.
* **Multi-device orchestration** with parallel programming patterns

### Documentation That Mattered

I authored internal design specs that **defined what "passing units" on the production floor meant**, including:

* Antenna alignment and performance tolerances.
* Power output ranges and spectral purity.
* Integration test protocols for mesh behavior and thermal tests.
* Device bring-up docs and low-level hardware flashing.

> These documents became **reference standards** used by hardware teams across continents.

### Data-Driven Debugging

* Used Python to parse and visualize gigabytes of performance logs, network connectivity, and interference.
* Automated time-correlated plots comparing RF output vs. control signal logs for deeper root-cause detection.
* Provided actionable insights to domain experts in timely manner with data visualization and presentations

### Global Impact: Taiwan Training & Manufacturing QA

* Flew to contract manufacturing facilities in Taiwan.
* Delivered hands-on training to QA and test engineers.
* Introduced Python-based test workflows to replace error-prone Excel macros.
* Unified test scripts across remote sites (US, APAC).

> Achieved a reduction in test failure rates by over 50% within 3 months.

### Reflections

* RF testing includes art + engineering, especially at 60 GHz, **which I love**.
* Working on Terragraph prepared me for my later AR/VR roles (low-level measurement, large-scale automation, cross-team validation).

**Automation isn't just faster testing, it's repeatable knowledge transfer at scale.**
