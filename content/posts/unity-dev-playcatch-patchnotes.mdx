## Patch Notes

### 6/19

- Found potential fix for Multiplayer Test
- Camera v1: Orbital Camera and Throw Mode
- Charged Throw with added pitch and throw-from-hand

### 6/18

- Fresh Unity Project
- Followed the `Mirror Quick Start Guide`
- Working local multiplayer
- Swapped Transport Layer to Steam.NET
  - Added Steam.NET and FizzySteamworks
- Built and shipped `0.0.1`
- Testing Steam Friends Multiplayer: Failed to Connect

## Current Work:

Backlogging network test and focussing on `Catch` functionality from local side


- Camera Control Movement Change
  - the WASD controls should make the character run and face in that direction
  - when Throw Mode is enabled make the character rotate to the direction of the camera
- Rework Weapon.cs to be about holding a ball in hand
  - balls will be a list of prefabs
- Ball Networking
  - onCatch of a ball destroy the ball and put that ball from list in hand
  - if not holding a ball
    - network event to broadcast the player is now holding a ball
    - network event to broadcast to destroy the ball
- Networked Scene Objects (targets, scoreboard, rigidbodies)
- Power Levels
  - Like selecting clubs in a golf game: close, medium, long
