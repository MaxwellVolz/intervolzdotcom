Blender Day went GREAT! We have a park and some streets and a horrible looking sign for Tony Niks. Hell yes.

Today we are focussing on getting a network test going.

Goal: Start Game, invite friend from Steam Friends list, they can join.

We have local networking setup using Mirror and KCP Transport that works.

What else do we need to add to complete the integration with Steam?

## Adding Steam.NET and FizzySteamworks to Unity

Unity → Edit → Project Settings → Player → **Other Settings**
* Api Compatibility Level → `.NET Framework 4.x`

### Install Steamworks.NET

Use Git URL:

```
https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET.git?path=/com.rlabrecque.steamworks.net#2024.8.0
```

Create `steam_appid.txt` at root of Unity project with contents `480`:

This allows your standalone builds to run SteamNetworking via AppID 480 ("Spacewar"—Steam’s test app).

### **Install FizzySteamworks via UPM**

Window ▶ Package Manager ▶ `+` ▶ Add from Git URL:

```
https://github.com/Chykary/FizzySteamworks.git?path=/com.mirror.steamworks.net
```

Once installed, check that:

* You see **FizzySteamworks** in your Packages list
* You can `Add Component ▶ FizzySteamworks` to your NetworkManager object

---

## Configure NetworkManager for FizzySteamworks

In **NetworkManager GameObject** (Prefab or Scene):

* **Add Component**: `FizzySteamworks`
* In `NetworkManager > Transport` → drag the FizzySteamworks component
* Delete `KCPTransport` if you’re not using fallback LAN play

---

## **Build**

The final `.exe` or `.app` must live next to `steam_appid.txt` and be run via **Steam** client.

---

## Testing Steam Friends Multiplayer

> You **cannot** test P2P with yourself — Steam requires two separate accounts on different machines.

### Host

* Run the game build via Steam
* Click *Host*
* Press Shift+Tab → open Steam overlay → Invite Friend

### Client (Josh!)

* Run the game
* Accepts invite → joins automatically if `NetworkManager.StartClient()` is called

Next Up for Blender

Semi-Procedural Buildings!

The current buildings are just...boxes. Yikes.

Josh send a link and at minute 4 we paused and opened Blender. [Joshs link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rexNuTap44&list=PLcRX9rXhXHWiaRgVPCdp8811YLsGdDeK7)
