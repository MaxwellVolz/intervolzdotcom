Back again with some **Unity Development**.

## Unity 6!

It's been a while but everything seems familiar...

##  What We're Building

**PlayCatch** â€” a light, casual, social game where you throw balls at each other and try to catch 'em. Think recess meets ragdolls. Simple gameplay, big vibes.

The goal is to make something fun, low-stakes, and multiplayer-ready â€” quick sessions, soft physics, just enough jank to make you laugh.

## What We Got Working

Functional MVP controller built in Unity 6 using the new Input System:

- Smooth 3D movement, jump support
- Orbiting chase camera
- Pickup and throw interaction
- Physics-based throws with spin and arc
- A visual throw **trajectory line**
- Target hoops that react when you score
- Blend tree animation with smooth-ish transitions

The throw is fully **camera-based**, meaning where you look is where the ball goes. Super intuitive and sets us up for all kinds of trick shots.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s on deck:

- Add **catch detection** and reaction
- Improve throw/catch animations
- Handle **networked multiplayer** with Netcode for GameObjects
- Add character select and maybe some cosmetics
- Better visual effects
    - slow-mo catch cam
    - ball cam chase
- A lobby flow and short game session structure

Casual, chaotic fun â€” the kind you can load up with a few friends and just vibe. Stay tuned for the next part as we bring it online.

Catch you later ðŸ¤™
