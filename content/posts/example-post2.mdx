Stereotypes can be helpful! Just as the internet predicts, because I am:

I enjoy getting lost on `Wikipedia`. I can't help it!

Last week or so I stumbled upon (The Dragon Curve)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve].

Biiiiig fractal fan. Math. Nature. Recursion.

Yes. Yes. Yaaaaaaas. lol.

From Wikipedia

> A dragon curve is any member of a family of self-similar fractal curves, which can be approximated by recursive methods such as Lindenmayer systems.
> The dragon curve is probably most commonly thought of as the shape that is generated from repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half, although 
> there are other curves that are called dragon curves that are generated differently.

Very cool. And how's it look?

The Heighway dragon is also the limit set of the following iterated function system in the complex plane:

Veeeerry math.

Lets break it down

TODO - image (Radio guy from Overwatch)

Considering the initial set of:

```sh
s_0 = {0,1}

f_1(z) =     ( ( 1 + y ) * z ) / 2
f_2(z) = 1 - ( ( 1 - y ) z ) / 2
```

Using Real numbers instead:

```sh
f_1(x,y) = ( 1 / (sqrt(2)) ) * ((cos45deg - sin45deg)/ (sin45deg +co45deg)) * (x/y)
f_2(x,y) = ( 1 / (sqrt(2)) ) * ((cos45deg - sin45deg)/ (sin45deg +co45deg)) * (x/y)
```


```py
import svgwrite
from math import cos, sin, radians


def generate_dragon_curve_commands(order, size=2):
    directions = [0]  # 0 degrees points to the right
    # Generate directions for each turn
    for _ in range(order):
        new_directions = [
            d + 90 for d in directions[::-1]
        ]  # Reverse and rotate left 90
        directions = (
            directions + [0] + new_directions
        )  # Append with a right turn (0 degree change)

    # Starting position
    x, y = 400, 400
    commands = [f"M{x:.2f},{y:.2f}"]
    for angle in directions:
        x += size * cos(radians(angle))
        y += size * sin(radians(angle))
        commands.append(f"L{x:.2f},{y:.2f}")
    return commands
