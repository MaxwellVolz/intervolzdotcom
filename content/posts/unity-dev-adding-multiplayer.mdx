## 🎯 GOAL: Strip Boss Room to Multiplayer Catch Core

> Note: This effort has been abandoned for the `Mirror + FizzySteamWorks + Steamworks.NET` implementation and kept here for reference.

### Network Architecture Goals

1. Players join multiplayer through Steam friends
2. Players and Balls are sync’d using Netcode for GameObjects
    1. players position
    2. players animation state
    3. ball position and ownership

Reading the [Unity Netcode Docs](https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/netcode/current/about/)...

Unity’s recommendation for friend-based sessions without dedicated servers is peer-to-peer with **Listen Server** architecture

Advantages:

- One player is **host** and **server** (i.e. a *listen server*), and others connect as **clients**
- No dedicated server infrastructure needed

Sync Behavior:

- Player positions (with NetworkTransform)
- Player animation states (with NetworkAnimator or custom RPCs/NetworkVariables)
- Ball state (ownership transferred on throw/catch)

Authority Model:

- Server-authoritative movement for players
- Ownership-transfer for balls, so the player who throws gains temporary authority


###  Gameobjects / Hierarchy

- Gameobjects
  - NetworkManager
- Prefabs
  - Player
    - Scripts
        - PlayerController - -organizes importing the others
        - PlayerInputs
        - PlayerActions
        - PlayerNetworking
        - PlayerMovement
    - GameObjects
      - leftHand
      - rightHand
      - Catch Area trigger
  - Ball

### Networking

- RPCs
  - Throw Events
  - Consecutive Catches - tracked per ball
  - TODO: what else
- Synced with Network Objects / Animators / Transforms
  - Position
  - Animators
  - Balls
    - in environment
    - being held by character

### Gameplay Functionality

- Player Movement
  - Blender Tree: Idle -> Walk -> Sprint
  - Trigger: Jump - hold for up to 1 second for larger jump
  - Trigger: Catch
  - Trigger: Dive - if sprinting and jump
  - Trigger: Pickup
  - Trigger: Aim Mode - prepare to throw
    - Change Camera to over the shoulder aiming like a grenade throw with a line renderer
    - Triggers: Release throw
- Cinemachine Camera
  - Orbit Camera
  - Over the Shoulder Aiming Mode for target and pitch selection

### PHASE 1: Clone & Boot

**Objective**: Get the Boss Room project building and running.

* Clone [Boss Room GitHub repo](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop)
* Open in Unity (same Unity version as project)
* Test Relay/Lobby: Build & run a local host/client game
* Confirm input, camera, player movement work

1. Installed the Unity version 2022.3 something
2. Built game
3. Connected via lobby system
4. Test movement and abilities

---

### PHASE 2: Rework systems be rework for catch

**Objective**: Keep the netcode + character systems, creatively rework RPG logic into fast, action-oriented mechanics.

- sprint
- action skills become movement skills: dash, vault, teleport
- rpg stats become bonuses to: stamina, speed, sprint speed, throw power, vision(zoom), catch area
- item stats can give bonuses and +/-

---

### 🛠 TASKS

#### Repurpose RPG Systems

- Created `ConcreteActions/DashAction.cs`
- Created `BossRoom/Actions/Dash Action`
- Updated Skills - `Assets/GameData/Character/Rogue/Rogue.asset`
- Added Action Prototype -> `Assets/Prefabs/GameDataSource.prefab`
- Updated: `Assets\Scripts\Gameplay\Configuration\CharacterClass.cs`
  - Added Stats: SprintSpeed, ThrowPower, CatchRadius, Stamina, ZoomMultiplier

#### Disable/Remove Unused Combat

* [X] 🗑 Strip boss/AI enemy prefabs from scene

- Disabled Spawners in `Assets/Scenes/BossRoom/DungeonEntrance`
  
#### Add Catch Gameplay Mechanics

* [X] Networked Balls
* [X] Pickup and Throw Balls

- Create prefab: `Assets/Prefabs/Balls/OriginalBall.prefab`
  - NetworkObject, Rigidbody (with gravity), SphereCollider, Ball script
  - Set Tag: Heavy, Layer: NPCs
- Created: `Assets/Scripts/Gameplay/Action/ConcreteActions/ThrowBallAction.cs`

### 🎮 PHASE 3: Repurpose Player Logic for Catch

**Objective**: Replace core movement/interaction with Catch gameplay

* [ ] ✅ Keep `NetworkCharacterState`, but rename/refactor to `CatchPlayer`
* [ ] 🎯 Add ball pickup logic (like `Interact` but simplified)
* [ ] 🔁 Add `Ball` prefab with `NetworkObject`, `Rigidbody`, `Throw()` method
* [ ] ✋ Add `HoldPoint` on player prefab for attaching balls
* [ ] ✅ Sync ball ownership + position for holding
* [ ] ➕ Add throw power charge + server-authoritative throw

---

### 🎥 PHASE 4: Camera & Input

**Objective**: Use or replace Boss Room's input + camera system

* [ ] 🎯 Strip unused input actions from Input System
* [ ] ✅ Keep `ClientInputSender` or replace with new `PlayerInputHandler`
* [ ] 🔁 Add aim/look input for mouse-aim throwing
* [ ] 🎥 Replace Boss Room's top-down camera with third-person Cinemachine rig
* [ ] 🧪 Test local + remote camera behavior (only Owner should drive)

---

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 PHASE 5: Multiplayer & Sync

**Objective**: Ensure all key objects sync properly

* [ ] ✅ Keep `NetworkObject` on player + ball prefabs
* [ ] 🔁 Use `NetworkAnimator` for synced animations (throw, catch)
* [ ] 🔄 Make sure thrown ball syncs position, velocity, and rotation server-side
* [ ] 🛠 Validate ownership transfer for caught balls
* [ ] 🧪 Test sync with 2+ clients (can they see each other throw + catch?)

---

### 🧽 PHASE 6: Polish & Steam Prep

**Objective**: Finalize build + prepare for Steam

* [ ] ✅ Replace Boss Room UI art/assets with Catch! branding
* [ ] ✅ Rename scripts and namespaces to `PlayCatch`
* [ ] 🎮 Implement simple scoreboard / catch count sync
* [ ] ✅ Replace launcher/menu with simple host/join UI
* [ ] ✅ Confirm build works on Steam with Steam transport (or fallback to Unity Relay)
* [ ] 🧪 Run build + catch test with 2 Steam accounts

---

## 🧩 Optional: Add Later

* Lobby/Relay reintegration
* Steam Friends invite flow
* Gamepad support
* Custom character skins
