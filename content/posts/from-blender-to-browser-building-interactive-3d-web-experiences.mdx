Let’s explore how to build a fully interactive 3D scene on the web using React, Three.js, and Blender.

Whether you're creating a portfolio, game environment, or immersive brand experience, this guide walks you through modeling in Blender, exporting to GLTF, rendering in the browser, and hooking up custom interactivity with ReactJS.

## 0. Project Setup

### Scaffold project folder with `npx` and `nextjs`

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest three-demo --typescript
cd three-demo
```

Install dependencies and make folders

```sh
npm install three
npm i --save-dev @types/three
npm i --save-dev autoprefixer
mkdir pages/scene
touch pages/index.tsx pages/scene.tsx
```

Or...[clone the repo at this step]('/')

## 1. Building the 3D Scene with Three.js

We’ll start by initializing a minimal scene with a camera, lights, and a simple environment using React.

`pages/index.tsx':
```tsx
import Link from 'next/link';

export default function Home() {
    return (
        <main style={{ padding: '2rem' }}>
            <h1>Welcome to the 3D Demo</h1>
            <Link href="/scene">Go to Scene</Link>
        </main>
    );
}
```

`pages/scene.tsx`:
```tsx
// pages/scene.tsx
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import * as THREE from 'three';

export default function ScenePage() {
    const mountRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

    useEffect(() => {
        const width = mountRef.current?.clientWidth ?? window.innerWidth;
        const height = mountRef.current?.clientHeight ?? window.innerHeight;

        const scene = new THREE.Scene();
        const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, width / height, 0.1, 1000);
        camera.position.z = 2;

        const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true });
        renderer.setSize(width, height);
        mountRef.current?.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

        const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry();
        const material = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial();
        const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
        scene.add(cube);

        function animate() {
            cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
            cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
            renderer.render(scene, camera);
            requestAnimationFrame(animate);
        }
        animate();

        return () => {
            renderer.dispose();
            mountRef.current?.removeChild(renderer.domElement);
        };
    }, []);

    return <div ref={mountRef} style={{ width: '100%', height: '99vh' }} />;
}
```

## 2. The Blender → Browser Pipeline

Blender is our modeling + animation hub. We’ll use `.glb` format for exporting clean, optimized models with animation baked in.

- Export settings: format, axis alignment, materials
- Tools for checking polycount and texture usage
- How to name animations and objects for clarity
- *Video/GIF:* Exporting a model → loading it in the browser
- Pro tip: Use empties or naming conventions for interactive elements

---

## 3. Hooking Up Animations

Time to make your scene come alive.

- Keyframing animations in Blender (e.g. door open, object rotate)
- Loading animation clips via `useAnimations`
- Triggering them with React state and refs
- *Video:* Create + preview a simple animation in Blender
- *Live Demo:* A button that plays an animation on click

---

## 4. 🖱 Making It Interactive

Now let’s give users something to do.

- Adding clickable areas with raycasting (e.g. `onPointerDown`)
- Using groups/empties in Blender as interaction targets
- Triggering animations, camera moves, or content reveals
- Example: Click a lamp to turn it on, a door to open, a screen to play video
- UX polish: Use hover feedback (glow, color shift)

---

## 5. UX Tips for 3D Web Design

3D is powerful—but easy to overdo. Here's how to keep it usable.

- Performance: reduce poly count, compress textures, lazy load
- Accessibility: fallback for touch devices, no-WebGL
- UX: don’t animate everything; focus user attention
- Camera limits: orbit controls should feel intentional

---

## 6. Final Touches

Structure matters for scale and maintenance.

- Organizing GLTF assets and code modules
- Decoupling scene logic from UI state
- Optional: Dynamically load content (CMS, config file, or JSON)
- Tips for exporting as a static site with Next.js

---

## Conclusion

You now have the tools to create rich, animated, and interactive 3D web scenes.
