* Brief story of wanting more than a flat website.
* Why Blender + Three.js + React
* What readers will learn (and a preview of the end result).

---

#### 1. Building the 3D Scene with Three.js

* Setting up a basic Three.js scene with lighting and camera.
* Using React Three Fiber to abstract away boilerplate.
* ✨ *Code snippet:* Minimal working scene using `@react-three/fiber`
* 🖼️ *Image or GIF:* Screenshot or recording of the working room.

---

#### 2. The Blender → Browser Pipeline

* Exporting GLB/GLTF models from Blender.
* Considerations for polycount, materials, baked animations.
* Using `@react-three/drei`’s `useGLTF()` to load models in the scene.
* 🎥 *Video/GIF:* Export in Blender → model appears in browser.
* 🔧 Tips: How to structure scenes/layers in Blender for export clarity.

---

#### **3. Hooking Up Animations**

* Creating and naming animations in Blender.
* Triggering animations in Three.js using `useAnimations` and refs.
* 🧪 *Live example:* A button that triggers an animation like a door opening.
* 🎥 *Video:* Creating a quick animation in Blender.

---

#### **4. Making It Interactive**

* Adding hotspots or clickable objects in the scene.
* Using raycasting or event handlers from R3F to trigger actions.
* Example: Click on a book to open it / turn on a lamp / teleport.
* ✨ Extra polish: Add subtle hover glow or animations to guide interaction.

---

#### **5. UX Tips for 3D Web Design**

* Keep it performant: decimate, compress, lazy load.
* Keep it accessible: fallback for non-WebGL or mobile users.
* Avoid motion overload: when to animate and when to pause.
* Add camera guides or control constraints (e.g. orbit limits).

---

#### **6. Final Touches**

* How to structure the project for reusability.
* How to integrate CMS or content slots into the scene.

---

#### **Conclusion**

* Link to demo / GitHub / code sandbox.
