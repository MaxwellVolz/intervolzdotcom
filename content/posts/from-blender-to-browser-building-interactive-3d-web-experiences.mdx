Let’s explore how to build a fully interactive 3D scene on the web using React, Three.js, and Blender.

Whether you're creating a portfolio, game environment, or immersive brand experience, this guide walks you through modeling in Blender, exporting to GLTF, rendering in the browser, and hooking up custom interactivity with React Three Fiber.

### Tech Stack

| Tech     | Description                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| Next.js  | React framework for the web   |
| Three.js | WebGL-based 3D engine         |
| R3F      | React Three Fiber abstraction |
| Blender  | 3D modeling & animation tool  |

### What You'll Learn

- How to set up a basic 3D scene in the browser using Three.js and React
- How to export animated models from Blender and load them with R3F
- How to trigger animations and build interactive experiences with event handling
- Tips for keeping performance sharp and UX smooth on 3D websites

---

## 1. 🛠 Building the 3D Scene with Three.js

We’ll start by initializing a scene with a camera, lights, and a simple environment using React Three Fiber.

- Structure of a minimal R3F scene
- ✨ *Optional:* Add lighting and shadows for depth
- 🖼️ *Include Screenshot/GIF:* Room rendering preview

---

## 2. 🔄 The Blender → Browser Pipeline

Blender is our modeling + animation hub. We’ll use `.glb` format for exporting clean, optimized models with animation baked in.

- Export settings: format, axis alignment, materials
- Tools for checking polycount and texture usage
- How to name animations and objects for clarity
- 🎥 *Video/GIF:* Exporting a model → loading it in the browser
- 🔧 Pro tip: Use empties or naming conventions for interactive elements

---

## 3. 🎬 Hooking Up Animations

Time to make your scene come alive.

- Keyframing animations in Blender (e.g. door open, object rotate)
- Loading animation clips via `useAnimations`
- Triggering them with React state and refs
- 🎥 *Video:* Create + preview a simple animation in Blender
- ✨ *Live Demo:* A button that plays an animation on click

---

## 4. 🖱 Making It Interactive

Now let’s give users something to do.

- Adding clickable areas with raycasting (e.g. `onPointerDown`)
- Using groups/empties in Blender as interaction targets
- Triggering animations, camera moves, or content reveals
- Example: Click a lamp to turn it on, a door to open, a screen to play video
- ✨ UX polish: Use hover feedback (glow, color shift)

---

## 5. 🧩 UX Tips for 3D Web Design

3D is powerful—but easy to overdo. Here's how to keep it usable.

- 🔄 Performance: reduce poly count, compress textures, lazy load
- 📱 Accessibility: fallback for touch devices, no-WebGL
- 🧠 UX: don’t animate everything; focus user attention
- 🎯 Camera limits: orbit controls should feel intentional

---

## 6. 🧱 Final Touches

Structure matters for scale and maintenance.

- Organizing GLTF assets and code modules
- Decoupling scene logic from UI state
- Optional: Dynamically load content (CMS, config file, or JSON)
- Tips for exporting as a static site with Next.js

---

## ✅ Conclusion

You now have the tools to create rich, animated, and interactive 3D web scenes.
