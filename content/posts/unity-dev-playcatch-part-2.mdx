1. Camera
   1. Third-Person Chase Orbital Camera
      1. Chase Cam with orbital controls using mouse/joystick
   2. Right-Click to enter `Grenade Throw Mode`
      1. Overshoulder Cam for precision aiming with vertical tilt
2. Throwing the ball
   1. Power Levels
      1. Like setting drivers in a golf game: close, medium, long
   2. When in `Throw Mode`:
      1. Left click should start powering up a throw
      2. Release to throw

## Next To Add

  - balls will be a list of prefabs
- ball networking
  - onCatch of a ball destroy the ball and put that ball from list in hand
  - if not holding a ball
