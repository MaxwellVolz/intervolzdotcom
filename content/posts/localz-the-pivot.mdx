## Gameplay Concept

Become a local in North Beach, San Francisco.

Engage in social rituals, earn local status, and uncover a deeper simulation of community living and urban play.

## Gameplay Loop

* Complete tasks at real-world locations to build rapport with neighborhood NPCs.
* Unlock deeper relationships and social interactions:

  * NPCs start greeting you by name.
  * Access to minigames, secret challenges, and insider info.
* Make money doing local deliveries.
* Customize your look with cosmetics.
* Uncover hidden layers of the simulation.
* **TODO:** Add long-form questlines, environmental modifiers, weather, time-of-day effects.

## Technical TODO

### Quests System

* Implement **proximity-based triggers** (e.g. “Hey! Listen!”)

  * Example: character in the park offers a narrated introduction
* Store quest data in structured JSON/YAML (by location or NPC)

### Challenges System

* Short skill-based or timing-based mechanics at known hotspots
* Examples: dice at Bing’s, oyster eating competition

### Social Interactions

* Implement **reputation system** per NPC
* Unlock new conversation branches, perks, or items based on social level
* Agent-based dialogue trees with probabilistic or branching logic

### Character Progression

* Leveling or notoriety system tied to local recognition
* Cosmetic unlocks via vendors (hats, shoes, ball trails)
* All data stored in easy-to-edit formats per location/NPC
