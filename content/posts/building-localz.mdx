## Technical TODO

### Quests System

* Implement **proximity-based triggers** (e.g. “Hey! Listen!”)
  * Example: character in the park offers a narrated introduction
* Store quest data in structured JSON/YAML (by location or NPC)

### Challenges System

* Short skill-based or timing-based mechanics at known hotspots
* Examples: dice at Bing’s, oyster eating competition
* Pub Crawl

### Social Interactions

* Implement **reputation system** per NPC
* Unlock new conversation branches, perks, or items based on social level
* Agent-based dialogue trees with probabilistic or branching logic

### Character Progression

* Leveling or notoriety system tied to local recognition
* Cosmetic unlocks via vendors (hats, shoes, ball trails)
* All data stored in easy-to-edit formats per location/NPC
