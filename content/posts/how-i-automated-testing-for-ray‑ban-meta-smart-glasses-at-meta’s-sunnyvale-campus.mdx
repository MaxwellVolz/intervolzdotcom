### 1. Prologue: Where Data Meets Design

* Intro: *I’m a Principal Engineer in AR/VR Automation with 10+ years of experience building scalable automation frameworks for hardware‑software systems.*

### 2. The Product: Ray‑Ban Meta Smart Glasses in Focus

* Overview of Ray‑Ban Meta: second‑generation smart glasses launched September 27, 2023, featuring 12 MP camera, Qualcomm Snapdragon AR1 Gen 1, integrated Meta AI voice assistant and livestreaming capabilities ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray-Ban_Meta?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Ray-Ban Meta")).
* Positioned at the intersection of fashion and consumer AI, blending minimalist Ray‑Ban design with advanced voice and camera tech ([Vogue Business](https://www.voguebusiness.com/story/technology/metas-far-sighted-fashion-moment?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Meta's far-sighted fashion moment"), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray-Ban_Meta?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Ray-Ban Meta")).
* Privacy conversation: small recording LED, third‑party facial recognition hacks spotlight ethical implications ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray-Ban_Meta?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Ray-Ban Meta")).

### 3. Challenge: Testing a Fashion‑Forward AI Device

* The unique constraints: wearable form factor, multiple development boards, real‑time voice and camera integration, battery limits, and cross‑team collaboration with hardware engineers.
* Goal: automate end‑to‑end testing of capture, streaming, voice commands, and Meta AI responses under real‑world conditions and day-of-use.

### 4. The Framework: Automation That Bridged Software & Hardware

* Led design of a Python‑based test harness that used serial and socket interfaces to interact with prototype hardware over RF and sensor interfaces.
* Devised real‑time performance monitoring pipelines using kernel‑level tracing with **Perfetto**, capturing CPU/GPU events tied to system resource consumption ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray-Ban_Meta?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Ray-Ban Meta")).
* Handled aggregation from multiple endpoints using Python’s `threading` and `queue` modules to cut time to visualization dramatically.

### 5. Real Moments: Tweaking Data for Real‑World Use

* Implemented edge detection algorithms for precise event triggers—like the exact millisecond a user taps the touchpad or says "Hey Meta".
* Enabled robust synchronization between video capture, audio command response, and live streaming to Instagram/Facebook SDKs.
* The result: consistent, reliable test results replicable across teams.

### 6. From Old to New: Modernizing Legacy Tooling

* Migrated existing legacy Python scripts to modular, test‑driven code compatible across Linux/macOS prototypes.
* Improved maintainability, portability, and integration with version control and CI/CD pipelines—streamlining collaboration between software and hardware engineers.

### 7. Mentorship & Documentation

* Tutored junior engineers and cross‑functional stakeholders, demystifying low‑level tracing and automation techniques.
* Created in‑depth documentation on the testing architecture, smoothing onboarding and future expansion.

### 8.  What I learned:

Building automation solutions isn’t just about code coverage. **It’s about orchestrating real‑world hardware interactions reliably.**
