There's nothing I know of worse than concepting an idea and losing it due to an idle task.

I excuse my messy apartment a result of attempts to stay on idea rather than stay on task.

Stay on task.

Fucking lol. 

We've so much going on and are consumed with the latest upkeep. 

Did people not socialize before dishwashers? 

I don't have one. 

Washer machines? 

Nope. 

Makes it easier to live unkempt.

Digression. 

Losing an idea sucks. 

Loosening an idea can suck worse. 

Compromise is without compromise.
