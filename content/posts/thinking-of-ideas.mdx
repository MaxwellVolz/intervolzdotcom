The mental anguish caused by concepting an idea and losing it due to an idle task is trying.

I excuse my messy apartment as a result of attempts to stay on idea rather than stay on task.

*Stay on task.*

So much new to do yet constantly strangled by upkeep. 

Did people not socialize before dishwashers? 

I don't have one. 

Washer machines? 

Nope.

Makes it easier to live unkempt.

Digression. 

Losing an idea sucks. 

Loosening an idea can suck worse. 

Compromise is without compromise.
