Well *jonatron*, I will!

Also, amazing handle.

## Data Processing

### Current Data Format

day (as unix timestamp / 86400), dash/emdash/count/both, count

Example Snippet:

```csv
13135,count,34
13139,dash,10
13143,dash,31
13147,count,102
13148,count,81
13129,dash,12
13140,dash,24
```

### Data Target Format

1. Sort by day
2. Group by day for d3 visualizations
3. Calculate metrics (em dash rates, etc.)
4. Output optimized JSON format

**It's Python time!**

1. injest the raw CSV
2. groups all dash-related counts by day
3. sorts the days
4. computes per-day metrics like dash rates
5. converts days into real dates
6. write out both a sorted CSV and a JSON dataset
7. print overall summary stats and trend comparisons across the dataset

Annnnd...done. Probably. 

Data looks like this now:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "day": 13129,
      "date": "2005-12-12",
      "count": 76,
      "dash": 12,
      "emdash": 0,
      "both": 0,
      "emdashRate": 0.0,
      "dashRate": 15.7895,
      "bothRate": 0.0,
      "anyDashRate": 15.7895
    },
  ]
}
```

## Making it a Website

Setup project with the following:

- **Next.js 16** - React framework with static export
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Modern utility-first styling
- **D3.js 7** - Interactive data visualization
- **Python 3** - Data processing pipeline

UI elements looking pretty **'99**, let's try out **HeadlessUI**...

And that was a big waste of time!

## Thoughts on Tailwind CSS + HeadlessUI

The **shadcn + Tailwind + Radix** primitives turns basic UI building into a maze of unnecessary abstraction and ceremony.

I wanted a styled component library and what I got was:

- a design system skeleton
- 40 layers of indirection
- low-level primitives that weren’t meant to be seen
- CSS variables you have to maintain
- at-rules that VSCode doesn’t recognize
- configuration scattered across `globals.css`, `tailwind.config.ts`, and *Radix wrappers*


### You wanted a switch?

shadcn gives you:

```tsx
<SwitchPrimitives.Root> - what the hell even is this
<SwitchPrimitives.Thumb> - a switch...THUMB?! what.
```

- 40 Tailwind classes
- CSS variables for colors
- dark mode variants
- data-state attributes for animation
- a wrapper ref-forwarding function
- every customizable part exposed whether you need it or not

And I'm left scratching my bald head:

> "Why do I need six files and three systems to render a toggle?"

I'm not trying to **engineer** a switch. I want to *use* a switch.

## Pivot Time: Material UI

Instead of being frustrated (I'm not anymore!).

Switching to a known library that looks nice and is less untamed (thanks Google).

Annnnd we have something to post on the thread!

### Jonatron responds!

*And the fire is re-lit!*

Let's make this nice for real.

### Material(izing) the design

Annnnnnnd...**Material UI Charts is a scam.**

Yep. I said it. 

This is on the [Overview Page](https://mui.com/x/react-charts/) that I based my sketch on.

![](/uploads/emdash-observer/muix_example.png)

But...too bad. Example code for this doesn't actually exist.

The entire concept (as it seems to me) is to pull you in with the most basic looking charts and put generic features like *setting a time range* or *zoom* behind a paywall. *A subscription paywall...yikes.*

**Despicable.**

Here's the last pass before the pivot:

While awaiting the growing frustration to completely rip *Material* out of my stack I will simple replace the chart with...

### Recharts!

Nice! Fun. Easy. I think there's a few too many data points (it lags) but I am much happier with the result.

Plus I didn't have to pay the *GoogleGods* any $.

More to come, maybe.
