## Intro

Saw this post on hackernews today.

[Em Dash in Reddit Comments (jonatron.github.io)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46236514)

Currently it has 3 comments.

Well *jonatron*, I will!

Also, amazing handle.

## Data Processing

### Current Data Format

day (as unix timestamp / 86400), dash/emdash/count/both, count

Example Snippet:

```csv
13135,count,34
13139,dash,10
13143,dash,31
13147,count,102
13148,count,81
13129,dash,12
13140,dash,24
```

### Data Target Format

1. Sort by day
2. Group by day for d3 visualizations
3. Calculate metrics (em dash rates, etc.)
4. Output optimized JSON format

**It's Python time!**

1. injest the raw CSV
2. groups all dash-related counts by day
3. sorts the days
4. computes per-day metrics like dash rates
5. converts days into real dates
6. write out both a sorted CSV and a JSON dataset
7. print overall summary stats and trend comparisons across the dataset

Annnnd...done. Probably. 

Data looks like this now:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "day": 13129,
      "date": "2005-12-12",
      "count": 76,
      "dash": 12,
      "emdash": 0,
      "both": 0,
      "emdashRate": 0.0,
      "dashRate": 15.7895,
      "bothRate": 0.0,
      "anyDashRate": 15.7895
    },
  ]
}
```

Setup project with the following:

- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Modern utility-first styling
- **D3.js** - Interactive data visualization
- **Python 3** - Data processing pipeline

UI elements looking pretty **'99**, let's try out **HeadlessUI**...

And that was a big waste of time!

## Thoughts on Tailwind CSS + HeadlessUI

tl;dr

way too granular and exotic for my current tastes

### The setup is wild

We eventually landed on the shadcn/...

# Will write up more on this tomorrow it's late.
