This year I am developing a presence on Hackernews.

I submitted my [Tribute to Sol LeWitt](https://intervolz.com/sollewitt) as a "Show HN" post at **12:02:05 PM PST**. [link](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46965968)

> Show HN is for something you've made that other people can play with. HN users can try it out, give you feedback, and ask questions in the thread.

Here's how the day unfolded.

---

### tl;dr

- 43 HN points → ~2k visitors / 17,948 hits
- Traffic surge held ~10 hrs
- Home Server + Cloudflare handled it flawlessly
- Spread to 9+ aggregators beyond HN
- I'm happy with it

## Hour One

Not even an upvote. I was plummetting to the bottom of the stack.

~220 hits on my site. **Zero upvotes**. 

The post was sitting somewhere on *Page 5*. 

I checked a few times, saw it hadn't moved, and figured that was it. I sent a text that said "nobody likes me" *lol*.

I know most HN submissions die a short death. That's just how it works.

## Getting Traction

I kept glancing over at my other monitor where the real-time traffic was open. Nothing.

The gaps between checks got longer. Still nothing.

Just after 2pm...**BANG!**

A couple upvotes. Refresh. It jumps. *Page 2*.

Refresh again.

*The Front Page*. Sitting there between the usual mix of deep tech posts and Show HNs.

**Stoked.** I've been reading articles and checking links at this exact location for over a decade.

It peaked at **#16**. Not the top, but *on the page*. For a solo side project I built over a weekend, that felt pretty great.

The spike was sharp. A big burst over a few hours with a long tail through the rest of the day.

## Traffic Overview (4-Day Window)

Here's what it looked like from the server side. My little Intel NUC was serving static files through Cloudflare, so it handled the load fine, but the numbers were wild compared to my normal traffic of basically zero.


| Date       | Hits       | Bandwidth    |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Feb 8      | 39         | 1.0 MB       |
| Feb 9      | 11         | 0.4 MB       |
| **Feb 10** | **17,948** | **280.0 MB** |
| Feb 11     | 6,483      | 82.1 MB      |

From ~25 hits/day to **17,948**...a **718x increase**.

> Data sourced from nginx access logs via GoAccess 1.9.3. All traffic routed through Cloudflare Tunnel to a local Intel NUC.

## Where Did They Come From?

| Source                    | Description                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| news.ycombinator.com      | Direct HN front page clicks       |
| intervolz.com (self)      | Internal navigation / asset loads |
| google.com / google.co.uk | Google search referrals           |
| hckrnews.com              | HN aggregator                     |
| brutalist.report          | HN aggregator                     |
| lobste.rs                 | Tech community                    |
| t.co (Twitter/X)          | Social sharing                    |
| hnrss.org                 | HN RSS feeds                      |

I love hackernews for its lack of fluff, but there's a whole ecosystem of sites that mirror or enhance HN content: [hckrnews.com](https://hckrnews.com), [hnews.xyz](https://hnews.xyz), various RSS readers, and social media bots that auto-post trending stories.

They *do pull metadata*. Preview images, I didn't have one set. Annnnd my crappy favicon for intervolz. Welp! I'll do better next time.

I was **#5** on hckrnews.com the first time I ever visited the site. Pretty cool moment.

### Device Breakdown

| Type    | Hits  | Share  |
| ------- | ----- | ------ |
| Desktop | 6,408 | 66%    |
| Mobile  | 3,289 | 34%    |
| Tablet  | 23    | &lt;1% |

### Platform

| OS      | Hits  | Share | Global Share* |
| ------- | ----- | ----- | ------------- |
| macOS   | 3,108 | 31%   | ~6%           |
| Windows | 2,108 | 21%   | ~29%          |
| Android | 2,004 | 20%   | ~43%          |
| iOS     | 1,721 | 17%   | ~18%          |
| Linux   | 1,192 | 12%   | ~1.5%         |

**Linux** and **macOS** significantly overrepresented due to HN audience skew.

### Bot vs. Human Traffic

| Type        | Hits   | Share |
| ----------- | ------ | ----- |
| Human       | 15,640 | 87%   |
| Bot/Crawler | 2,308  | 13%   |

Bots include generic `bot` user agents, RSS readers (SpaceCowboys), and crawlers that followed the HN post.

**12% cache hit rate** via `304 Not Modified` thanks to Cloudflare and browser caching doing their job.

### Security Noise

The HN visibility also attracted the usual automated scanning:

| Attack Vector                                               | Hits   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| WordPress probes (`/wp-login.php`, `/wp-admin/`)            | 1,718+ |
| PHP shell attempts (`/alfa.php`, `/sx.php`, `/x.php`, etc.) | 400+   |
| Git config exposure (`/.git/config`)                        | 32     |
| Environment file probes (`/.env`)                           | 22     |

All returned **404**. There's no PHP, no WordPress, no `.git`, and no `.env` on this server. Real-world penetration test passed.

### HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Count  | Meaning                                 |
| ---- | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 200  | 15,623 | OK - full response served               |
| 304  | 2,179  | Not Modified - browser cache hit        |
| 301  | 146    | Redirect (trailing slash normalization) |

### Notable User Agents

| Agent                             | Hits    | What It Is              |
| --------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------- |
| `HackerNews/1536 CFNetwork`       | 2,310   | Official HN iOS app     |
| `SpaceCowboys Android RSS Reader` | 348     | Android RSS reader      |
| Generic `bot`                     | 412     | Unidentified bots       |
| `OAI-SearchBot`                   | present | OpenAI's search crawler |

## Why It Survived the Hug of Death

1. **Fully static:** No database, no server-side rendering, no API calls. Just HTML, JS, CSS, and fonts.
2. **Cloudflare caching:** CDN absorbed repeat requests; only ~12% of requests hit origin with 304s.
3. **Canvas 2D rendering is client-side:** The expensive generative art computation happens in each visitor's browser, not on the server.
4. **Small payload:** Full page load ~170KB (compressed). The NUC never broke a sweat.
5. **Zero downtime:** 0 `5xx` errors on /sollewitt paths. Every single request was served successfully.

For a few hours, something I made for fun was sitting in front of one of the most technical audiences on the internet, being shared, and they liked it. 

And then, just as fast as it arrived, the wave rolled back out.

But, for this afternoon, my weekend project was part of the front page of Hacker News.

Not bad.
