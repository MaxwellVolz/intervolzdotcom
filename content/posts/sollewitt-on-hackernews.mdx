**This year I am developing a presence on Hackernews.**

I submitted [Tribute to Sol LeWitt](https://intervolz.com/sollewitt) as a ["Show HN" post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46965968) at **02/10/2026 12:02:05 PM PST**.

> Show HN is for something you've made that other people can play with. HN users can try it out, give you feedback, and ask questions in the thread.

## Origin and Context of Project

### Short History

While cleaning up some old bookmarks I came across [solving sol](https://solvingsol.com/), a project I saved **7 years ago**. I created the repo November 14th, 2018. Yeesh.

Unfortunately, I committed a `README.md` and proceeded to never push any further local development. I remember experimenting with Canvas, making the first few drawings, and not being quite happy with the results.

*Fast forward to 2026.*

I still love art. I still love programming. And I still love **Sol Lewitt**. So I built it.

### Bonus History

I read through [solving sol](https://solvingsol.com/) and looked up the author, [Brad Bouse](https://bradwearsglasses.com/).

Cool guy with a cool website. I snoop around. Finally get to his LinkedIn...wait a second. 

**HE WORKED AT YAMMER?!?!**

What. Small world. Let me explain...

I did a single day job shadow at Yammer in 2010 that **changed my life**. It was the day I decided I was going to pursue programming as a career.

Sadly, according to LinkedIn, he had already moved on by the time I did my job shadow.

Welp. If you see this, Brad, I just sent you a message on LinkedIn :salute:.

Ok! Now for the stats...

## Analysis

Here's how the day unfolded.

### Hour One

Not even an upvote. I was plummetting to the bottom of the stack.

~220 hits on my site. **Zero upvotes**. 

The post was sitting somewhere on *Page 5*. 

I checked a few times, saw it hadn't moved, and figured that was it. I sent a text that said "nobody likes me" *lol*.

I know most HN submissions die a short death. That's just how it works.

### Getting Traction

I kept glancing over at my other monitor where the real-time traffic was open. Nothing.

The gaps between checks got longer. Still nothing.

Just after 2pm...**BANG!**

A couple upvotes. Refresh. It jumps. *Page 2*.

Refresh again.

*The Front Page*. Sitting there between the usual mix of deep tech posts and Show HNs.

**Stoked.** I've been reading articles and checking links at this exact location for over a decade.

![Hacker News front page](/imgs/sol_hn_frontpage.jpeg "On the front page!")

It peaked at **#16**. Not the top, but *on the page*. For a solo side project I built over a weekend, that felt pretty great.

The spike was sharp. A big burst over a few hours with a long tail through the rest of the day.

### Traffic Overview (4-Day Window)

Here's what it looked like from the server side. My little Intel NUC was serving static files through Cloudflare, so it handled the load fine, but the numbers were wild compared to my normal traffic of basically zero.


| Date       | Hits       | Bandwidth    |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Feb 8      | 39         | 1.0 MB       |
| Feb 9      | 11         | 0.4 MB       |
| **Feb 10** | **17,948** | **280.0 MB** |
| Feb 11     | 6,483      | 82.1 MB      |

From ~25 hits/day to **17,948**...a **718x increase**.

> Data sourced from nginx access logs via GoAccess 1.9.3. All traffic routed through Cloudflare Tunnel to a local Intel NUC.

> I've since added google analytics so my next post-op will have much more information!

## Where Did They Come From?

| Source                    | Description                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| news.ycombinator.com      | Direct HN front page clicks       |
| intervolz.com (self)      | Internal navigation / asset loads |
| google.com / google.co.uk | Google search referrals           |
| hckrnews.com              | HN aggregator                     |
| brutalist.report          | HN aggregator                     |
| lobste.rs                 | Tech community                    |
| t.co (Twitter/X)          | Social sharing                    |
| hnrss.org                 | HN RSS feeds                      |
| hn.premii.com             | HN aggregator                     |
| Facebook                  | Social sharing                    |
| hackerweb.app             | HN reader app                     |

I love hackernews for its lack of fluff, but there's a whole ecosystem of sites that mirror or enhance HN content: [hckrnews.com](https://hckrnews.com), [hnews.xyz](https://hnews.xyz), various RSS readers, and social media bots that auto-post trending stories.

![betacat](/imgs/sol_hn_betacat.png "betacat aggregator")

They *do pull metadata*. Preview images, I didn't have one set. Annnnd my crappy favicon for intervolz. Welp! I'll do better next time.

I was **#5** on hckrnews.com the first time I ever visited the site. Pretty cool moment.

## Who are they?!

### Device Breakdown

| Type    | Hits  | Share  |
| ------- | ----- | ------ |
| Desktop | 6,408 | 66%    |
| Mobile  | 3,289 | 34%    |
| Tablet  | 23    | &lt;1% |

### Platform

| OS      | Hits  | Share | Global Share* |
| ------- | ----- | ----- | ------------- |
| macOS   | 3,108 | 31%   | ~6%           |
| Windows | 2,108 | 21%   | ~29%          |
| Android | 2,004 | 20%   | ~43%          |
| iOS     | 1,721 | 17%   | ~18%          |
| Linux   | 1,192 | 12%   | ~1.5%         |



**Linux** and **macOS** significantly overrepresented due to HN audience skew.

### Bot vs. Human Traffic

| Type        | Hits   | Share |
| ----------- | ------ | ----- |
| Human       | 15,640 | 87%   |
| Bot/Crawler | 2,308  | 13%   |

Bots include generic `bot` user agents, RSS readers (SpaceCowboys), and crawlers that followed the HN post.

**12% cache hit rate** via `304 Not Modified` thanks to Cloudflare and browser caching doing their job.

### Security Noise

The HN visibility also attracted the usual automated scanning:

| Attack Vector                                               | Hits   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| WordPress probes (`/wp-login.php`, `/wp-admin/`)            | 1,718+ |
| PHP shell attempts (`/alfa.php`, `/sx.php`, `/x.php`, etc.) | 400+   |
| Git config exposure (`/.git/config`)                        | 32     |
| Environment file probes (`/.env`)                           | 22     |

All returned **404**. There's no PHP, no WordPress, no `.git`, and no `.env` on this server. Real-world penetration test passed.

### HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Count  | Meaning                                 |
| ---- | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 200  | 15,623 | OK - full response served               |
| 304  | 2,179  | Not Modified - browser cache hit        |
| 301  | 146    | Redirect (trailing slash normalization) |

### Notable User Agents

| Agent                             | Hits    | What It Is              |
| --------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------- |
| `HackerNews/1536 CFNetwork`       | 2,310   | Official HN iOS app     |
| `SpaceCowboys Android RSS Reader` | 348     | Android RSS reader      |
| Generic `bot`                     | 412     | Unidentified bots       |
| `OAI-SearchBot`                   | present | OpenAI's search crawler |

### How I Survived the Hug of Death

1. **Fully static:** No database, no server-side rendering, no API calls. Just HTML, JS, CSS, and fonts.
2. **Cloudflare caching:** CDN absorbed repeat requests; only ~12% of requests hit origin with 304s.
3. **Canvas 2D rendering is client-side:** The expensive generative art computation happens in each visitor's browser, not on the server.
4. **Small payload:** Full page load ~170KB (compressed). The NUC never broke a sweat.
5. **Zero downtime:** 0 `5xx` errors on /sollewitt paths. Every single request was served successfully.

## The Week After (Feb 11–17)

> Data sourced from nginx access logs for the 7 days following the HN post. Feb 17 is partial (through ~11:30 AM PST).

### Daily Overview

![](/imgs/sol-week.png "the week after")


| Date                | Total Hits | /sollewitt Hits |
| ------------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| **Feb 10 (HN day)** | **24,222** | **17,948**      |
| Feb 11              | 16,140     | 7,116           |
| Feb 12              | 13,985     | 7,157           |
| **Feb 13**          | **18,231** | **12,391**      |
| Feb 14              | 10,212     | 2,672           |
| Feb 15              | 3,485      | 1,546           |
| Feb 16              | 5,080      | 590             |
| Feb 17 (partial)    | 1,500      | 251             |


### The Feb 13 Secondary Spike

Traffic saw a **secondary surge on Feb 13** due to:

#### **HN still driving clicks**

Continued engagement from `news.ycombinator.com` with 920 referrals 3 days after submission.

#### **Google search traffic peaked**

358 Google referrals (vs 184 on Feb 11), suggesting the post had been indexed and people were finding it through search.

#### **Crawler activity**

958 bot/crawler hits mixed in, plus heavy overnight traffic (1,000+ hits/hr from midnight–3 AM) from indexing bots.

#### **HN iOS app still active**

1,484 combined hits from HackerNews/CFNetwork user agents.

The hourly pattern on Feb 13 was distinctly different from Feb 10 with traffic spread more evenly.

### The Long Tail of Referral Sources

Referral traffic evolved as the post propagated outward:

![](/imgs/sol-referrals.png "referrals")


**lobste.rs** delivered a consistent ~50 referrals/day for the entire week, outlasting both HN and Google traffic.

The first version of post you're reading now drove a secondary wave on Feb 12 (131 hits), as visitors who found the project on HN came back to read the writeup.


### Continued Reliability

Zero `5xx` errors across the entire post-HN period. Every request served successfully for all 7 days:

| Status           | Total (Feb 11–17) |
| ---------------- | ----------------- |
| 200 OK           | 24,785            |
| 304 Not Modified | 6,659             |
| 301 Redirect     | 127               |
| 404 Not Found    | 152               |
| 5xx              | **0**             |

Yesssssssssssss.



### Wrap Up

For a few hours, something I made for fun was sitting in front of one of the most technical audiences on the internet, being shared, and they liked it!

And then, just as fast as it arrived, the wave rolled back out.

But, for this afternoon, my weekend project was part of the front page of Hacker News.

Not bad.
