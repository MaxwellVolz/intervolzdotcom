- A static site on a home Intel NUC behind Cloudflare handled the entire HN front page load with **zero errors**
- The post rippled out to **9+ aggregator/social platforms** beyond HN itself

## February 2nd at Noon

I submitted [the Sol LeWitt generator](https://intervolz.com/sollewitt) to Hackernews and it didn't completely flop!

| Metric | Value                                                                                  |

| Title  | *Show HN: Sol LeWitt-style instruction-based drawings in the browser*                  |
| Link   | [news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46965968](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46965968) |

## Hour One

Not even an upvote. I was plummetting to the bottom of the stack.

~220 hits on my site. **Zero upvotes**. 

The post was sitting somewhere on page 5 of `/new`. 

I checked a few times, saw it hadn't moved, and figured that was it. I sent a text that said "nobody likes me" *lol*.

I know most HN submissions die a short death. That's just how it works.

## Getting Traction

I had my `GoAccess` logs pulled up on a second monitor to monitor the web traffic in real-time and `Unique Visitors` was crawling...

Then it started picking up! A few upvotes and bang! Page 2.

And then it was on the front page. Sitting right there between the usual mix of Show HNs and tech articles.

Stoked. I've been reading articles and checking links at this exact location for a decade.

![Hacker News front page](/imgs/sol_hn_frontpage.jpeg "On the front page!")

It peaked at **#16**. Not the top of the page, but *on the page*. For a solo side project I built over a weekend, that felt pretty good.

The spike was sharp. A big burst over a few hours, a long tail through the rest of the day, and trending back to normal now.

## February 10th - Hourly Breakdown

The classic HN spike: sharp ramp, sustained plateau, gradual tail-off.

## Traffic Overview (4-Day Window)

Here's what it looked like from the server side. My little Intel NUC was serving static files through Cloudflare, so it handled the load fine, but the numbers were wild compared to my normal traffic of basically zero.

Data sourced from nginx access logs via GoAccess 1.9.3. All traffic routed through Cloudflare Tunnel to a local Intel NUC.

> Note: I host other things from my home server so this first table is **all** my traffic.

| Date                | Total Hits | Unique Visitors | Bandwidth    |
| ------------------- | ---------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| Feb 8 (baseline)    | 6,198      | 177             | 187.3 MB     |
| Feb 9 (baseline)    | 2,955      | 101             | 142.3 MB     |
| **Feb 10 (HN day)** | **24,222** | **2,083**       | **827.6 MB** |
| Feb 11 (tail)       | 16,077     | 580             | 289.6 MB     |

**Total bandwidth served over the HN window: ~1.45 GB**
**Traffic multiplier on HN day: 5x** the baseline average

### /sollewitt/* Specifically

| Date       | Hits       | Bandwidth    |
| ---------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Feb 8      | 39         | 1.0 MB       |
| Feb 9      | 11         | 0.4 MB       |
| **Feb 10** | **17,948** | **280.0 MB** |
| Feb 11     | 6,483      | 82.1 MB      |

From ~25 sollewitt hits/day to **17,948** - a **718x increase**.


## What I Learned

**Metadata matters more than you think.** I love HN because of its lack of fluff. Just a text link, no previews, no images. But there's a whole ecosystem of sites that mirror or enhance HN content: [hckrnews.com](https://hckrnews.com), [hnews.xyz](https://hnews.xyz), various RSS readers, and social media bots that auto-post trending stories.

![hckrnews.com](/imgs/sol_hn_hckrnews.png "How the post looked on hckrnews.com")

These sites *do* pull metadata. Open Graph images, descriptions, page titles, etc. If your page has a good `og:image` and a clear `og:description`, your post looks significantly better on these aggregators compared to a bare link with no preview. It's the difference between someone scrolling past and someone clicking through.

### Where Did They Come From?

| hackerweb.app             | 5     | HN reader app                     |


The **HackerNews iOS app** was the single largest user agent with **2,310 hits** (`HackerNews/1536 CFNetwork`).


### Device Type

| Type    | Hits  | Share  |
| ------- | ----- | ------ |
| Desktop | 6,408 | 66%    |
| Mobile  | 3,289 | 34%    |
| Tablet  | 23    | &lt;1% |

### Platform

| OS      | Hits  | Share |
| ------- | ----- | ----- |
| macOS   | 3,108 | 31%   |
| Windows | 2,108 | 21%   |
| Android | 2,004 | 20%   |
| iOS     | 1,721 | 17%   |
| Linux   | 1,192 | 12%   |

**Linux at 12%** - significantly above the global ~2-4% desktop share. Classic HN audience skew.

![betacat](/imgs/sol_hn_betacat.png "betacat aggregator")

I didn't have great metadata set up initially. I didn't think about it! I realized this from digging into the referring sites to see where people were coming from. Something to fix for next time.

**The HN audience is generous with feedback.** The comments were constructive, positive, and interesting.

## Bot vs. Human Traffic

| Type        | Hits   | Share |
| ----------- | ------ | ----- |
| Human       | 15,640 | 87%   |
| Bot/Crawler | 2,308  | 13%   |

Bots include generic `bot` user agents, RSS readers (SpaceCowboys), and crawlers that followed the HN post.

### HTTP Status Codes (/sollewitt, Feb 10)

| Code | Count  | Meaning                                 |
| ---- | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 200  | 15,623 | OK - full response served               |
| 304  | 2,179  | Not Modified - browser cache hit        |
| 301  | 146    | Redirect (trailing slash normalization) |

**12% cache hit rate** via `304 Not Modified` - Cloudflare and browser caching doing their job.

### Why It Survived the Hug of Death

1. **Fully static:** No database, no server-side rendering, no API calls. Just HTML, JS, CSS, and fonts.
2. **Cloudflare caching:** CDN absorbed repeat requests; only ~12% of requests hit origin with 304s.
3. **Canvas 2D rendering is client-side:** The expensive generative art computation happens in each visitor's browser, not on the server.
4. **Small payload:** Full page load ~170KB (compressed). The NUC never broke a sweat.
5. **Zero downtime:** 0 `5xx` errors on /sollewitt paths. Every single request was served successfully.

## Bandwidth Breakdown (/sollewitt on Feb 10)

| Category                       | Size         | Share |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ | ----- |
| Static assets (JS, CSS, fonts) | 228.7 MB     | 82%   |
| HTML page responses            | 51.3 MB      | 18%   |
| **Total**                      | **280.0 MB** |       |

The Next.js bundle (`4bd1b696-*.js` at 53KB/load and `255-*.js` at 52KB/load) accounted for the bulk of static bandwidth.

## Security Noise

The HN visibility also attracted the usual automated scanning:

| Attack Vector                                               | Hits   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| WordPress probes (`/wp-login.php`, `/wp-admin/`)            | 1,718+ |
| PHP shell attempts (`/alfa.php`, `/sx.php`, `/x.php`, etc.) | 400+   |
| Git config exposure (`/.git/config`)                        | 32     |
| Environment file probes (`/.env`)                           | 22     |

All returned **404** - there's no PHP, no WordPress, no `.git`, and no `.env` on this server.

## Notable User Agents

| Agent                             | Hits    | What It Is              |
| --------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------- |
| `HackerNews/1536 CFNetwork`       | 2,310   | Official HN iOS app     |
| `SpaceCowboys Android RSS Reader` | 348     | Android RSS reader      |
| Generic `bot`                     | 412     | Unidentified bots       |
| `OAI-SearchBot`                   | present | OpenAI's search crawler |

Not a bad day 😎
